## üìù Description

This project is a complete evolution of a basic image resizer. It was built to explore modern web design trends like **glassmorphism** and to integrate real-time 3D graphics using **`three.js`**. The application is purely client-side, meaning all image processing happens directly in your browser, ensuring privacy and speed.

## üöÄ Features

* **Easy Image Upload:** Click to upload or drag & drop your image.
* **Custom Resizing:** Set custom width and height in pixels.
* **Aspect Ratio Lock:** Maintain the original image proportions with a single click.
* **Live Previews:** See a preview of the uploaded image and the final resized image.
* **Instant Download:** Download your resized image directly to your device.
* **Dynamic 3D Background:** An animated, real-time background built with `three.js` featuring abstract shapes.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** A sleek, modern "frosted glass" interface.
* **Responsive Design:** Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the application.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including Flexbox, Grid, custom properties, and the glassmorphism effect.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, including DOM manipulation, file handling, and image processing with the Canvas API.
* **Three.js:** For creating and animating the 3D background scene.
